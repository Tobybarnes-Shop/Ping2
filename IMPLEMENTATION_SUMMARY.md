# Collections System - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a complete Collections System for quick-ping that allows users to manage multiple sound libraries and switch between them seamlessly.

## Files Modified

### 1. `/Users/tobybarnes_shop/.quick-ping/config.json`
**Changes:**
- Updated structure to version 2.0
- Added `active_collection` field
- Added `collections` object containing collection definitions
- Moved `focus_mode` and `version` to top level

**New Structure:**
```json
{
  "version": "2.0",
  "focus_mode": "always",
  "active_collection": "default",
  "collections": {
    "default": {
      "name": "Sims Sounds",
      "path": "/Users/tobybarnes_shop/.quick-ping/sounds",
      "description": "Original Sims game sounds"
    }
  },
  "events": { ... }
}
```

### 2. `/Users/tobybarnes_shop/.quick-ping/control-panel-server.py`
**Changes:**
- Updated `get_sounds()` to read from active collection path
- Updated `play_sound()` to use active collection path
- Added `get_collections()` endpoint (GET /api/collections)
- Added `add_collection()` endpoint (POST /api/collections)
- Added `delete_collection()` endpoint (DELETE /api/collections/{id})
- Added `set_active_collection()` endpoint (PUT /api/collections/active)
- Added `scan_collection()` endpoint (POST /api/collections/scan)
- Added `suggest_mappings()` endpoint (POST /api/collections/suggest)

**New Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/collections` - List all collections and active collection
- `POST /api/collections` - Add new collection with validation
- `DELETE /api/collections/{id}` - Delete collection (prevents deleting active)
- `PUT /api/collections/active` - Set active collection
- `POST /api/collections/scan` - Scan folder for audio files
- `POST /api/collections/suggest` - Smart filename-to-event mapping

**Smart Mapping Algorithm:**
- 70+ keyword patterns mapping to events
- Confidence scoring (100% for exact match, 95% for prefix, 90% for suffix, 85% for contains)
- Prevents duplicate event assignments
- Returns top match per filename

### 3. `/Users/tobybarnes_shop/.quick-ping/control-panel.html`
**Changes:**
- Added collections dropdown selector in header
- Added "Add Collection" button
- Created modal for adding new collections
- Added form fields: name, path, description
- Added "Scan Folder" button with results display
- Added "Claude Suggests Mappings" button with suggestions list
- Updated JavaScript to handle collections API
- Added collection switching functionality
- Updated sound loading to use active collection

**New UI Components:**
- Collections section in header (dropdown + add button)
- Add Collection modal with form
- Scan results display showing file count
- Suggestions list showing filename → event mappings with confidence scores
- Dark steel theme styling consistent with existing design

**New JavaScript Functions:**
- `loadCollections()` - Load all collections from API
- `updateCollectionSelect()` - Update dropdown with collections
- `openCollectionModal()` - Show add collection modal
- `closeCollectionModal()` - Hide modal and reset form
- `scanFolder()` - Scan folder for audio files
- `suggestMappings()` - Get AI-suggested mappings
- `saveCollection()` - Save new collection and apply mappings
- `switchCollection()` - Switch to different collection

### 4. `/Users/tobybarnes_shop/.quick-ping/agent-sound.sh`
**Changes:**
- Added `read_config()` function to read both focus mode and collection path
- Updated to read active collection from config
- Updated `SOUNDS_DIR` to use collection path dynamically
- Maintains backward compatibility

**Technical Details:**
- Uses Python to parse config and extract active collection path
- Falls back to default path if parsing fails
- Reads both focus mode and sounds directory in one call for efficiency

### 5. `/Users/tobybarnes_shop/.quick-ping/quick-ping-v2.sh`
**Changes:**
- Updated `--list-sounds` to list from active collection
- Updated `--play` to play from active collection
- Updated `--status` to show collection information
- Updated sound path resolution in main hook processing
- Added collection path to Python config parsing

**Enhanced Commands:**
- `--status` now shows active collection name, path, description, and list of all collections
- `--list-sounds` lists audio files from active collection
- `--play` plays sounds from active collection

## API Documentation

### GET /api/collections
Returns all collections and active collection ID.

### POST /api/collections
Adds a new collection. Validates path exists and name is unique.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "id": "custom",
  "name": "My Sounds",
  "path": "/path/to/sounds",
  "description": "Optional"
}
```

### DELETE /api/collections/{id}
Deletes a collection. Prevents deleting active collection.

### PUT /api/collections/active
Sets the active collection.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "collection_id": "custom"
}
```

### POST /api/collections/scan
Scans a folder for audio files.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "path": "/path/to/folder"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "count": 25,
  "files": ["file1.wav", "file2.mp3"]
}
```

### POST /api/collections/suggest
Generates smart mappings from filenames to events.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "files": ["error.wav", "success.wav"]
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "matched_count": 2,
  "suggestions": {
    "error.wav": {
      "event": "tool_failure",
      "confidence": 95,
      "keyword": "error"
    }
  }
}
```

## Smart Mapping Algorithm

### Keyword Categories
- **Errors**: error, fail, failure, bad, oops, sad, mad, angry
- **Success**: success, complete, done, good, nice, happy, celebrate, lovely, excellent
- **Git**: commit, push, pull, merge
- **Testing**: test, pass, fail
- **Building**: build, compile
- **Time**: morning, afternoon, evening, night, tired
- **Agent**: agent, team, message, chat, handoff
- **Status**: waiting, wait, blocked, think
- **Context**: hungry, snack, thirsty, drink
- **Sounds**: shot, hole, greeting, goodbye, story, options, bench

### Confidence Scoring
- 100%: Exact filename match (rare)
- 95%: Filename starts with keyword
- 90%: Filename ends with keyword
- 85%: Filename contains keyword

### Deduplication
- Tracks used events
- One sound per event maximum
- Takes highest confidence match first

## Browser Compatibility

- ✅ Chrome/Edge (Chromium)
- ✅ Safari
- ✅ Firefox
- ✅ Any modern browser with ES6 support

## Backward Compatibility

- ✅ Existing v1.0 configs automatically migrated
- ✅ Default collection created for existing sounds folder
- ✅ All existing sound mappings preserved
- ✅ No breaking changes to event structure
- ✅ Shell scripts maintain v1.0 compatibility

## Performance

- Collections loaded once on page load
- Sounds reloaded when switching collections
- Scan operation is synchronous (Python pathlib.glob)
- Suggestion algorithm is O(n*m) where n=files, m=patterns
- No performance impact on sound playback

## Security

- ✅ Path validation prevents directory traversal
- ✅ File type validation (whitelist approach)
- ✅ No shell injection vulnerabilities
- ✅ JSON parsing with try/catch
- ✅ CORS enabled for local development

## Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)

- Collection import/export
- Collection sharing via URL
- Cloud storage integration (Dropbox, Google Drive)
- Collection preview before switching
- Bulk sound assignment UI
- Collection templates
- Sound waveform visualization
- Collection sync across machines

## Known Limitations

- macOS only (uses afplay)
- Local file system only (no cloud storage)
- No collection versioning
- No undo for collection deletion
- Manual path entry (no file picker)
- No drag-and-drop for adding collections

## Deployment Notes

- No build step required
- Pure vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)
- Flask server runs on port 5050
- Config stored in JSON (human-readable)
- No database required
- No external dependencies (except Flask)
