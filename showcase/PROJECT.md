# Quick-Ping Showcase Site -- Project Brief

## What This Is

A standalone single-page showcase website for Quick-Ping v2.0 -- a sound notification system for Claude Code. Code name: "The Player." The showcase site lives separately from the main Quick-Ping repo and serves as the public face of the project.

## Goals

1. **Sell the experience** -- Make developers want to install Quick-Ping within 10 seconds of landing on the page
2. **Demo the contrast** -- Show two completely different sound experiences (MGS and Sims 2) and let the visitor choose their vibe
3. **Drive installation** -- Clear, frictionless path from "cool" to "installed and running"
4. **Establish brand** -- Position Quick-Ping as a neutral instrument that plays two very different records

## Target Audience

- **Primary**: Claude Code users who want richer feedback from their coding sessions
- **Secondary**: Developer tooling enthusiasts, retro gaming fans, people who like tasteful UI
- **Tertiary**: Anyone curious about AI-assisted development workflows

## What Quick-Ping Actually Does

Quick-Ping hooks into Claude Code's event system (PreToolUse, PostToolUse, Stop) and plays sound effects for 40+ events: git commits, test results, context warnings, streaks, and more. It ships with two collections:

- **MGS Collection** (124 sounds) -- Tactical Espionage Audio. Coding sessions become stealth missions. Codec rings, radar blips, the "!" alert at 90% context.
- **Sims 2 Collection** (140+ sounds) -- Simlish exclamations for every coding occasion. Warm, cheerful, chaotic.

Key product features:
- **Adaptive Control Panel** (localhost:5050) -- UI theme switches based on active collection (dark/tactical for MGS, light/playful for Sims)
- **Master Power Switch** -- One-click mute all sounds (Cmd+Shift+M), preserves event settings
- **Sound Description Labels** -- `sound_label` field on all 76 events so users know what they'll hear before pressing play
- **Claude Suggests** -- AI-powered sound-to-event mapping
- **Focus Modes** -- Smart mode only plays sounds when terminal isn't focused

## Design Direction: "The Player"

The site uses a **neutral-framework** approach. Think Spotify showcasing playlists -- the player itself is neutral, the playlists have their own worlds.

**Three visual layers:**

| Layer | Aesthetic | Sections |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| **Neutral frame** | Clean dark developer tool. White accents. No collection color. | Hero, How It Works, Event Map, CTA, Footer |
| **MGS world** | Dark, tactical, amber/green. Codec screen vibes. | MGS card, MGS deep-dive |
| **Sims world** | Lighter, warmer, teal. Plumbob colors, cheerful energy. | Sims card, Sims feature section |

**Critical rule**: Terminal green (`#00FF41`) is NOT a framework color. It belongs exclusively to the MGS aesthetic. The neutral framework uses white (`#FFFFFF`).

**No sound on the website itself.** The irony is intentional. Let visitors imagine the sounds.
